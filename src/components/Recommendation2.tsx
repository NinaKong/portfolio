              Nina worked on several projects with me at Cendyn. During my time working with Nina, she approached problems methodically and exhibits professionalism when it comes to client satisfaction and meeting deadlines. She was reliable and would work through any problems. Moreover, she's very enjoyable to work with and her tireless work ethic and positive attitude make her an invaluable asset to the team. I highly recommend her.
